This repository contains the work for the **Interactive Visualisation of Spatial Data** project, developed as part of the FIT3163 Data Science Project unit at Monash University.

Our goal is to design and build an intuitive, web-based platform that makes complex meteorological data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) accessible and easy to explore for students, educators, and the general public.
